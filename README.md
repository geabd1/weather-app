# weather-app

This is a weather application I made Spring 2021 for my Software Engineering/Design Class. It's the first project I ever did containing html/css and js, so it its quite basic. I consider it the starting point for my coding journey. When the html page is open, it will display the weather of the location of the device you are yousing it on. 

This was also my first time using an API to retrive the information. 
API: https://openweathermap.org/api (should be free)

Go on the site to get your api key and in the js file, paste the key. This is needed in order for it to work
